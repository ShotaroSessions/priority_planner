priority_planner Project Specifications:

A web app for prioritizing and planning lifelong and everyday goals.
Breaks larger goals up into smaller subgoals and tracks your progress 
throughout. Choose days you aim to complete certain goals at and check 
them off when finished or get a reminder if you haven't. Keeps track 
of completed goals in text files representing all events that happened 
while working toward completion. Goals can have a set progression to
completion or be dynamic. Daily and upcoming goals are displayed at 
the top of the web app on a bar with the link to the dashboard.

Goals are plans. They can be empty when representing smaller tasks 
that can be completed quickly. Goals can be nested in other goals. 
Goals with subgoals have an option to keep track of progress with a 
percentage of subgoals finished and/or progress bar. Goals can be put
in color coded categories.
